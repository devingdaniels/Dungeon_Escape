# Console-based Game in C++
Welcome to my console-based game written in C++! This game showcases my skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, class composition, and dynamic memory allocation.

## Game Description 
The game is called "Escape the Dungeon" and is set in a dark and dangerous dungeon filled with monsters, traps, and gold. The objective of the game is to navigate through the dungeon, collect as many gold as possible, find the key, and escape. 

## Features
Here are some of the features that I have implemented in this game:

OOP: I have used OOP principles to structure the game code into objects, making it modular and easy to maintain.

Data Structures: I have used 1D and 2D arrays to represent the game map, and linked-lists to store the game levels. 

Class Composition: I have created multiple classes that interact with each other to form the game logic, including the player, enemies, treasures, and game map.

Dynamic Memory Allocation: I have used dynamic memory allocation to create objects at runtime, allowing the game to scale dynamically and optimize memory usage.

# How to Play
To play the game, simply run the executable file on your console. You will be prompted to enter your name and then start the game. Use the A,W,S,D keys to move your character around the map, and collect treasures while avoiding enemies.

# Conclusion
Thank you for checking out my console-based game project. I had a lot of fun creating it, and it showcases my skills in OOP, data structures, class composition, and dynamic memory allocation. If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to reach out to me.
